                <h1 class="sub-title">About Me</h1>
                <p> Saida Reshid, is a <span class="color1">Doctoral Candidate in Cybersecurity Analytics</span> at <span class="color2">The George Washington University</span>. 
                    She is also a <span class="color3">Professional Data Scientist</span> with a <span class="color3">Master of Professional Studies in Data Science 
                    </span>from <span class="color2">University of Maryland Baltimore County</span> and a 
                    <span class="color3">Bachelor's in Mathematics</span>, as a Meyerhoff Scholar.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Saida's professional pathway began during her undergraduate years with internships focusing on biological and molecular research at 
                    <span class="color2">Johns Hopkins Medical Institute</span> and the <span class="color2">National Institutes of Health</span>. Experiences from that period led to a way of incorporating 
                    mathematical skills in real biological applications and provided a platform for her to transition into more focused 
                    research-oriented roles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After graduating, Saida entered the workforce at the <span class="color2">University of Maryland</span> and started working in Keller's lab on the role of 
                    serotonin in chronic pain using Python and data science. This consisted of developing algorithms for the analysis of 
                    physiological data from various animal models that help provide better insight into how differing serotonin level changes 
                    may give rise to chronic pain conditions. Her Python skills were invaluable as they facilitated the deciphering of complex 
                    datasets and enabled major research findings.</p>
                <br>
                <p>She then transitioned to a Data Scientist position at <span class="color2">Oncospace</span> applying her scientific depth from previous research on advanced 
                    data science methods to improve radiation dose predictions for improved planning and outcomes in radiation therapy for 
                    targeted cancer treatment. This was designing and developing supervised and unsupervised machine learning models related to 
                    clustering and decision trees, in regard to answering the question of the therapeutic outcome.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During Saida's data science master's program, she decided to choose a cybersecurity pathway which led to the development of her strong 
                    interest in cybersecurity, leading to her pursuit in a <span class="color3">Graduate Certificate in Cybersecurity Operations</span>. As she continued to 
                    explore the intersection of data science and cybersecurity, it became evident that pursuing a doctorate in Cybersecurity 
                    Analytics was the natural progression of her career. This decision was driven by her extensive research background and a keen 
                    interest in leveraging cybersecurity to safeguard digital infrastructures. Saida's future research will be on integrating 
                    cybersecurity and artificial intelligence to pioneer innovative approaches in digital security using her expertise in data 
                    science.</p>

                    <h3>Snort Challenge: The Basics</h3>
                    <p>In the "Snort Challenge — The Basics" project on TryHackme, Saida honed her network security skills by crafting and 
                        implementing a series of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) rules using Snort. This project encompassed setting up Snort, 
                        analyzing network traffic, and creating rules for HTTP and FTP traffic, PNG and GIF file detection, and complex threats 
                        like MS17-010 and Log4j exploits. This not only solidified her proficiency in using Snort but also enhanced her ability 
                        to apply theoretical knowledge practically, making it a standout addition to her professional portfolio.</p>

                <div class="layer">
                    <h3>Windows Security: A Comprehesnive Project on Defender and Firewall</h3>
                    <p>Saida took a hands-on project 
                        regarding the security features of Microsoft Windows, particularly on Windows Defender and Firewall. 
                        The project comprised several labs where she learned to navigate seamlessly in the Windows Security 
                        area, with a particular focus on critical functions of real-time detection of threats, facilities 
                        for system scanning, and reliable firewall settings. Saida conducted a detailed review, checked the 
                        updated definition of the virus, ran and analyzed the quick/custom scans of the antivirus, and then 
                        set up the firewall rules with more depth in setting measures for the respective network domains. She 
                        documented each step followed in detail to be able to reproduce such results and as a good practice 
                        in cybersecurity. This project has further honed her technical skill in working with key security 
                        tools within Windows, and increased her capacity to carry out very accurate and 
                        effective security protocols in any given digital infrastructure.</p>
